# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.2 (December 30, 2019)

- Add initial application structure
  - This is a bare bones application structure
    segregating out the schema, graph, resolvers,
    dataloaders, and other basic skeleton components.

## 1.0.1 (December 30, 2019)

- Add README and Makefile
  - Addition of a README and a Makefile to help users
    get started with the application. This is still a huge
    work in progress but a solid starting point in terms of
    documentation.

## 1.0.0 (December 30, 2019)

- Initial Commit
